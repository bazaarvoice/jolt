/**
 * Removr is a kind of JOLT transform that removes content from the input JSON.
 * <p/>
 * For comparison :
 * Shiftr walks the input data and asks its spec "Where should this go?"
 * Defaultr walks the spec and asks "Does this exist in the data?  If not, add it."
 *
 * While, Removr walks the spec and asks "if this exists, remove it."
 * <p/>
 * Example : Given input JSON like
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "~emVersion" : "2",
 *   "id":"123124",
 *   "productId":"31231231",
 *   "submissionId":"34343",
 *   "this" : "stays",
 *   "configured" : {
 *     "a" : "b",
 *     "c" : "d"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * With the desired output being :
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "id":"123124",
 *   "this" : "stays",
 *
 *   "configured" : {
 *     "a" : "b"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This is what the Removr Spec would look like
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "~emVersion" : "",
 *   "productId":"",
 *   "submissionId":"",
 *
 *   "configured" : {
 *     "c" : ""
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *  * Removr Wildcards
 *
 * '*' Wildcard
 *   Valid only on the LHS ( input JSON keys ) side of a Removr Spec
 *   The '*' wildcard can be used by itself or to match part of a key.
 *
 *   '*' wildcard by itself :
 *    To remove "all" keys under an input,  use the * by itself on the LHS.
 *    <pre>
 *    // example input
 *    {
 *     "ratings":{
 *        "Set1":{
 *           "a":"a",
 *           "b":"b"
 *        },
 *        "Set2":{
 *            "c":"c",
 *            "b":"b"
 *        }
 *      },
 *    }
 *    //desired output
 *    {
 *     "ratings":{
 *        "Set1":{
 *           "a":"a"
 *        },
 *        "Set2":{
 *            "c":"c"
 *        }
 *      },
 *    }
 *
 *    //Spec would be
 *    {
 *     "ratings":{
 *        "*":{
 *          "b":""
 *        },
 *      },
 *    }
 *    </pre>
 *    In this example, "Set1" and "Set2" under rating both have the same structure, and thus we can use the '*'
 *     to allow use to write more compact rules to remove "b" from all children under ratings. This is especially useful when we don't know
 *     how many children will  be under ratings, but we would like to nuke certain part of it across.
 *
 *   '*' wildcard as part of a key :
 *    This is useful for working with input JSON with keys that are "prefixed".
 *    Ex : if you had an input document like
 *    <pre>
 *        {
 *         "ratings_legacy":{
 *              "Set1":{
 *                  "a":"a",
 *                  "b":"b"
 *                },
 *              "Set2":{
 *                  "a":"a",
 *                   "b":"b"
 *               }
 *           }
 *
 *         "ratings_new":{
 *               "Set1":{
 *                   "a":"a",
 *                   "b":"b"
 *               },
 *               "Set2":{
 *                   "a":"a",
 *                   "b":"b"
 *               }
 *          }
 *       }
 *    </pre>
 *
 *    A 'rating_*' would match both keys. As in Shiftr wildcard matching, * wildcard is as non greedy as possible, which enable us to give more than one * in key.
 *
 *    For an ouput that removed Set1 from all ratings_* key, the spec would be,
 *     <pre>
 *        {
 *         "ratings_*":{
 *              "Set1":""
 *       }
 *    </pre>
 * <p/>
 *
 * <p>
 *  * Arrays
 *
 * Removr can also handle data in Arrays.
 *
 *  It can walk thru all the elements of an array with the "*" wildcard.
 *
 *  Additionally, it can remove individual array indicies.  To do this the LHS key
 *   must be a number but in String format.
 *
 *  Example
 *  <pre>
 *  "spec": {
 *    "array": {
 *      "0" : ""
 *    }
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  In this case, Removr will remove the zero-th item from the input "array", which will cause data at
 *   index "1" to become the new "0".  Because of this, Remover matches all the literal/explicit
 *   indices first, sorts them from Biggest to Smallest, then does the removing.
 * <p/>
