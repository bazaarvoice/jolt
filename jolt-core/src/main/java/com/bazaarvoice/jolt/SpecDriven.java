/**
 * Marker interface for Jolt Transforms that are based off a "spec".
 *
 * Implementations of this interface are expected to have a single arg constructor,
 * which takes an {@link Object} that is the spec for the constructed instance.
 * Chainr leverages this to instantiate these objects correctly.
 *
 * Additionally, all {@link SpecDriven} implementations should mark their constructor
 * with the {@link javax.inject.Inject} annotation, so that they can be loaded via
 * Dependency Injection systems.
 *
 * All of the "stock" Jolt {@link SpecDriven} transforms are marked with {@link javax.inject.Inject}.
 *
 * Ideally, calls to the transform method are expected to be stateless and multi-thread safe.
