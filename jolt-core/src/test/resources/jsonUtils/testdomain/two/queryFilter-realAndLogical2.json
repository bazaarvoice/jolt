// Silly "queryParam" is gone, but still have all values being Strings, e.g. "value": "3".
//
// Note this Json file is used by both testdomain two and three Java code.
//  Java "three" is nicer than "two", in that more logic was moved out of the MappingTest Module
//  into the LogicalFilter3 @JsonDeserializer
