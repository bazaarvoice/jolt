# Filing Issues and Feature Requests

The guidelines for issues are as follows: **don't be shy**.  As much detail as possible is always welcome, but issue volume around here is pretty low, so it's not a real burden to address stuff even if it's accidentally a dupe or needs some follow-up questions.

## Before Coding
**Before you do too much coding**, please make sure that you've either
* **Commented on the existing issue** you intend to try and tackle, or
* **Filed a new issue** proposing your idea

It would be a total shame to write a bunch of code only to realize someone else fixed the issue, or find out for whatever reason the changes you are proposing don't fit in the project.  Plus, this way you can get input on implementation ideas and any other support you might need.

*Note:* this is just a guideline of course.  If you've already slung some code and want to send a pull, it'll still be welcome.  With a bit of luck there won't be any reason not to merge it.


## Coding Guidelines

The coding guidelines are pretty simple:

* Write tests surrounding your change
** Diffy is your friend
* Ensure that all existing tests pass with your change
* Generally keep it clean and follow the coding style of the existing code

## Pull Requests

* To submit a change, just follow the standard fork/code/pull-request Github workflow
* Feel free to submit pulls marked "WIP" (Work in progress) to get early feedback and help
